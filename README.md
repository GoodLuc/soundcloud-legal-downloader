# soundcloud-legal-downloader

I wanted a way to see all the available tracks for (legal) download from my favorite SoundCloud artists without having to click track by track and see if the option was available.

This simple script parses the artist ID from a profile url or user name using the SoundCloud API and then fetches only the tracks that are download-enabled.

You can preview the tracks to listen to them first or directly download the files.

For usage, download the *dist* folder and run index.html

Enjoy!
